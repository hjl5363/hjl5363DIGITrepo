    <body>Hello everyone. My name is Harrion Lilley, and I am currently a second year student who is planning on majoring in Digital Media, Arts and Technology at Penn State Behrend. I am currently taking DIGIT 210, and I am in the full swing of starting things with my project group for that course. Here at Penn State Behrend, I am involved with both the Behrend Beacon and athletic department, and I take photos for both of them. As a result, you will see me at various events around campus! After graduation, I am planning on working for either the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, Penn State, the Mt. Lebanon School District or the Allegheny County Airport Authority.</body>
