# Harrison Lilley - Regex #4 Steps

1. I refrenced the Autotagging with Regular Expreessions tutorial to remind me of some commands that are used in Regex.

2. I put a carrot symbol into the Find and Replace tab, and instructed Oxygen to replace the beginning of a line with <sp> as suggested in the assignment. The carrot symbol indicates that there must be a match at the beginning of a text that is serarched. 

3. I them put a $ symbol into the Find and Replace tab, and then instructed Oxygen to replace the end of a line with </sp> as suggested in the assignment. The $ symbol matches the term if it appears at the end of a line or a paragraph. For example, thie Regex matches a paragraph that ends with dog: 1| dog$.

4. I then moved on to the second suggesstion that is noted in the assignment, which was escaping square brackets with \[ and \]. I then replaced it with nothing in order to get rid of the brackets. I made sure to check that "Dot matches all" was turned off in the Find and Replace Window, as this was noted in the homework assignment. I think it was essential to get rid of the brackets in order to avoid unnceccessary charecters throughout the process of the Regex assignment.

5. I met with Mia in the LRC, and she helped me with some of the errors that I have been making over the last couple of weeks, since I am not the best at coding.
