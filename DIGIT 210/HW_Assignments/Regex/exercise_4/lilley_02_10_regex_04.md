# Harrison Lilley - Regex #4 Steps

1. I refrenced the Autotagging with Regular Expreessions tutorial to remind me of some commands that are used in Regex.

2. I put a carrot symbol into the Find and Replace tab, and instructed Oxygen to replace the beginning of a line with <sp> as suggested in the assignment.

3. I them put a $ symbol into the Find and Replace tab, and then instructed Oxygen to replace the end of a line with </sp> as suggested in the assignment.

4. I then moved on to the second suggesstion that is noted in the assignment, which was escaping square brackets with \[ and \]. I then replaced it with nothing in order to get rid of the brackets. I made sure to check that "Dot matches all" was turned off in the Find and Replace Window, as this was noted in the homework assignment.

5. I met with Mia in the LRC, and she helped me with some of the errors that I have been making over the last couple of weeks, since I am not the best at coding.
