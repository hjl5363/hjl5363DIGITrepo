# Harrison Lilley - Steps That Were Taken During Regex Exercise 2

1. First, I started the assignment by checking searching and replacing charecters such as &, <, and >. I am not sure if this should have happened, but I did not get anything replaced by typing these commands.

2. I then put .+ in the Find and Replace dialog, as instructed to do so. As a result, I got all of the dots out of the document.

3. I looked up the Regex Expressions by referring to the Regex Expressions Introduction reading, and then I inserted the charecters for both the beginninh and the end of a line, and then asked OXygen to replace them with either <line> or </line>.

4. I then exported this as an XML document, which I will do a gitpush for next.
