# Harrison Lilley's Steps for Regex Exercise #1


Step #1: I downloaded the Movie Data .txt file from the assignment website, and I created a markdown file to record my steps for this assignment as well.

Step #2: I started to analyze the assignment, and I began the first step, and that was to check for special charecters, specifically & and changing it to &amp.

Step #3: I checked for other special charecters that may be in the document, but I did not end up finding any.

Step #4: I coped the single wrapper element into the Find function in Oxygen (<movie>....</movie>) in order to isolate each line as instructed to do so in the assignment.

Step #5: I then selected "Replace All" in Oxygen.

Step #6: I tried to do a \1, and it is indicating "String not found". I am pretty much stuck at this point in the assigment.
