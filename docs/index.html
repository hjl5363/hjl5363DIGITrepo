        <p>Hello everyone. My name is Harrison Lilley, and I am currently a student at Penn State Behrend. I am thinking of either majoring in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology, but I may end up majoring in Photography at University Park.t</p>
        <!--ebb: When pointing to images in your own repo, always use *relative* file associations: Here we are pointing to an images directory that's in the same
        folder as this HTML file we're editing. And we're going into the images folder to deliver the newt-mosaic4.png file inside. -->
        <p>We are at <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</a>.</p>

            Only do this for pointing OUTSIDE your own repo. -->
