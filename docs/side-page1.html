        <title>What I Currently Do In My Life</title>
    </head>
    <body>As I mentioned before, I am currently a student at Penn State Behrend majoring in Digital Media, Arts amd Technology. In the summer when I am not at school, I usually work at Emma Kaufmann Camp as the photographer there, and I also do some freelance jobs before and after EKC to "cushion" my summer schedule. During the school year, I take photos for the athletic department here at Behrend, and I am also the photographer for the Behrend Beacon.</body>
