        <title>My Life Before Behrend</title>
    </head>
    <body>I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA, and I attended Mt. Lebanon High School and graduated in 2020 before coming to Penn State Behrend. When I was in high school, I did a lot of photos for the yearbook, student newspaper, and I was also the photographer for the athletic department. I also participated in the Photography Club and was a member of the Food Service Advisory Board.</body>
