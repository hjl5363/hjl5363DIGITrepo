           <p>Most of the <orgName>XML Working Groups</orgName> have been closed by now; this year saw <orgName type="workGroup">XQuery</orgName> and <orgName type="workGroup">XSLT</orgName>
           close, their work successfully completed.
            As we wind down work on standardizing the XML stack at <orgName>W3C</orgName> it’s worth looking at some of
            what <!-- There was an angle bracket in front of "what". --> we have accomplished and why. <codeLang>W3C XML, the Extensible Markup Language</codeLang>, is one of
           the world’s most widely-used formats for representing and exchanging information. The
            final <codeLang type="stack">XML stack</codeLang> <!-- </codeLang> needed to have the slash put in front instead of the back of the word. -->is more powerful and easier to work with than many people know,
            especially for people who might not have used XML since its early days. <!-- There needed to be a slash added because "p" is a closing element in this case. -->
            Thank you to all who have contributed.</p>
