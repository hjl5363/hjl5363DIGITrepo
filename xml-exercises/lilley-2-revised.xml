        <metadata>The following letter was written shortly after Wilde's release from prison:,
            Rouen, August 1897</metadata>
        <greeting>My own Darling Boy,</greeting>
        <paragraph num="1">
            <mainsubject>I got your telegram half an hour ago,</mainsubject> and just send a line to
            say <feeling>that I feel that my only hope of again</feeling> doing beautiful work in
            art is being with you. It was not so in the old days, but now it is different, and you
            can really recreate in me that energy and sense of joyous power on which art
            depends.</paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2">Everyone is <feeling>furious with me for going back to you,</feeling> but
            they don't understand us. I feel that it is only with you that I can do anything at all.
            Do remake my ruined life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a different
            meaning to the world.</paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3">I wish that when we met at Rouen we had not parted at all. There are such
            wide abysses now of space and land between us. But we love each other. Goodnight, dear.
            Ever yours,</paragraph>
